Know the concepts
    01. 
        The program counter fetches the address of the next instruction.
        Decoder decodes the instruction, gathers resources and executes it.
    02.
        Register is a memory location that is available on CPU itself, as opposed 
        to memory.
        Computation would be much slower, in regards to execution speed.
        We would need to use memory to store all information, which would 
        cause more typing and more memory addresses that programmer would 
        need to remember.
    03.
        By using more bytes to represent it.
    04.
        4 bytes or 32 bits.
    05.
        Each instruction has a predefined opcode.
        If decoder fetches a value that matches one of the opcodes, it executes it.
    06. 
        Addressing modes are ways which we use to move data around.
    07.
        Points to the address of the next instruction that will be executed.

        Employee record:
            First name: 30 bytes
            Last name:  30 bytes, start+30 bytes
            Email       30 bytes, start+60 bytes
